                <h2>A Little bit about us</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Padnell Rovers were formed in the summer of 2014 starting out with 9 teams.</p>
                <p>Padnell initially played all their home games at Padnell recreation ground before moving to Paulsgrove
                    where finally settling at Beacon View Academy school and Sevenoaks Playing fields nearby.</p>
                <p>The club boast of a mini soccer school which we see as the base of our club and we will always look to
                    produce new under 7 teams each season from our mini soccer school.</p>
                <p>We are proud to say we are a charter standard club recognised by our leagues and of course Hampshire
                    FA.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, the club has had to meet various standards and pass certain criteria in order for our
                    club to exist, this includes ensuring the safeguarding of our children which is paramount, ensuring all
                    coaches are crc checked and FA level one qualified or above, ensuring our club has a correct structure
                    in place off the field. We are pleased to say we meet all of the above and more.</p>
                <p>We aim to promote a friendly club where everyone is welcome, we are currently looking at expanding and
                    strengthening the club as a whole across the board this season with various positive changes being put
                    into place for the 2017/18 season.</p>
                <p>We hope you all enjoy your time with us as a club and we hope your child progression and their love of
                    the game continues to grow.</p>
                <p>Many Thanks for your continued support,</p>
